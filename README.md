# Generative replay addition to TD3

PyTorch implementation of Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (TD3) with a generative replay component.

The code is heavily modified to work for my research needs

Method is tested on [MuJoCo](http://www.mujoco.org/) continuous control tasks in [OpenAI gym](https://github.com/openai/gym). 
Networks are trained using [PyTorch 1.7](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) and Python 3.8.
